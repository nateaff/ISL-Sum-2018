# Resources

## Getting started

* [Download R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* _Orientation_ video from [Datacamp's introduction to RStudio](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1)

## Introduction to Statistical Learning(ISL)

* [ISL website](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
* [List of lectures with links to video lectures and accompanying slides](http://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/)
* [R code for labs.](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/code.html)
Almost all of the code needed for answering the applied problems in the
assignments can be adapted from the code from the Labs. Googling is a perfectly
fine way to find answers to coding questions, but I'd recommend checking the Lab
code before resorting to Google or Stackoverflow.
* [The ISLR R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ISLR/index.html).
This package has some of the datasets and functions used in the Labs and Assignments.

## Datacamp

* [Datacamp's introduction to RStudio](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1)
* [Datacamp's introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)

## Getting Help

* [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Website for asking and answering
questions about programming. Can be unfriendly to beginners but is a good
reference for answers to common R questions.
* [RStudio community website](https://community.rstudio.com/)
. A friendly, geared-towards-beginners location to ask questions about Rstudio and R.
