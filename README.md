# Resources

## Getting started

* [Download R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* _Orientation_ video from [Datacamp's introduction to RStudio](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1)

## Introduction to Statistical Learning(ISL)

* [ISL website](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
* [List of lectures with links to video lectures and accompanying slides](http://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/)
* [R code for labs.](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/code.html)
Almost all of the code needed for answering the applied problems in the
assignments can be adapted from the code from the Labs. Googling is a perfectly
fine way to find answers to coding questions, but I'd recommend checking the Lab
code before resorting to Google or Stackoverflow.
* [The ISLR R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ISLR/index.html).
This package has some of the datasets and functions used in the Labs and Assignments.

## Datacamp

* [Datacamp's introduction to RStudio](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1)
* [Datacamp's introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)

## Getting Help

* [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Website for asking and answering
questions about programming. Can be unfriendly to beginners but is a good
reference for answers to common R questions.
* [RStudio community website](https://community.rstudio.com/)
. A friendly, geared-towards-beginners location to ask questions about Rstudio and R.

## R resources

### Additional Free Resources  

* [R for Data Science, Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)  Introduces readers to the 'Tidyverse' set of tools for data exploration, plotting and model buildling.
* [Advanced R, Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) Covers some more advanced topics but the first few topics in the _Foundations_ present some basics of R data types, data structures, subsetting and functions that could be useful even to R newbies.
* [David Robinson's R Course](http://varianceexplained.org/RData/) Video lectures and text that cover R basics, modeling and a section on `data.tables`, an alternative to R's `data.frames`.
* [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) A very user friendly book on text mining with R using the 'tidy' methods associated with packages from the tidyverse like `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot`.
