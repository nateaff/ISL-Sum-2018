# Project Assignment 1

1. Load your data set in R. Examine some of the column contents and types.

2. Choose one paper that is cited in the "F14 Field_subject_pool" excel file. Read the methods section and make a bullet point list of what information they include in the description of their data.

_(If you want me to choose one, look at the paper by Adam Grant, "Does Intrinsic Motivation Fuel the Prosocial Fire? Motivational Synergy in Predicting Persistence, Performance, and Productivity")._

3. Write a brief description of your dataset. For example, what kind of data does your dataset contain? What's the size of your dataset? What information does the data dictionary contain?
