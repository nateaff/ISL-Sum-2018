KDD, SEMMA AND CRISP-DM: A PARALLEL OVERVIEW
Ana Azevedo and M.F. Santos


The CRISP-DM process was developed by the means of the effort of a consortium initially composed with DaimlerChryrler, SPSS and NCR. CRISP-DM stands for CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It consists on a cycle that comprises six stages:

1. Business understanding – This initial phase focuses on understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective, then converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition and a preliminary plan designed to achieve the objectives.

2. Data understanding – The data understanding phase starts with an initial data collection and proceeds with activities in order to get familiar with the data, to identify data quality problems, to discover first insights into the data or to detect interesting subsets to form hypotheses for hidden information.

3. Data preparation – The data preparation phase covers all activities to construct the final dataset from the initial raw data.

4. Modeling – In this phase, various modeling techniques are selected and applied and their parameters are calibrated to optimal values.

5. Evaluation – At this stage the model (or models) obtained are more thoroughly evaluated and the steps executed to construct the model are reviewed to be certain it properly achieves the business objectives.

6. Deployment – Creation of the model is generally not the end of the project. Even if the purpose of the model is to increase knowledge of the data, the knowledge gained will need to be organized and presented in a way that the customer can use it.
